### Hi! I'm Jorge ArgÃ¼elles, MERN Fullstack developer training in Platzi Master program ðŸ‘‹

I believe in gamification is the next education revolution & the time is the most valuable resource in life.
I never stop learning, growing and questioning my cultural environment. I am analytical, goal oriented and systematic vision.

I enjoy working on projects that transform people and that technology leverages the reach and impact, that's why I want to create technology and gamify education.
